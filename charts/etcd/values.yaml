  # NOTE:
  # - 1000ms is the etcd default and is suitable for low-latency, single-region clusters.
  # - In high-latency or unreliable networks (for example, some cloud providers or
  #   cross-region deployments), this may be too aggressive and can cause
  #   unnecessary leader elections.
  # - Consider increasing this value based on your network characteristics and
  #   failure detection requirements.
  electionTimeout: 1000
  # Heartbeat interval (ms)
  # NOTE:
  # - 100ms is the etcd default and pairs with the election timeout above.
  # - In higher-latency environments, you may want to increase this value
  #   proportionally when tuning electionTimeout.
  # - Always evaluate changes in a staging environment before applying them
  #   to production clusters.
